   <h1> LAVA TUBE </h1>  
    <p>
      A lava tube, or pyroduct, is a natural conduit formed by flowing lava from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano">volcanic vent</a> 
      that moves beneath the hardened surface of a lava flow. If lava in the tube empties, it will leave a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave">cave</a>.</p>
  
   
  
<div class="aa"> 
  <h2>Formation</h2> 
  <p><p2>A</p2> lava tube is a type of 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava_cave">lava cave</a> 
    formed when a low-
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscosity">viscosity</a> 
    lava flow develops a continuous and hard crust, which thickens and forms a roof above the still-flowing lava stream. Tubes form in one of two ways: either by the crusting over of 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava_channel">lava channels</a>
    , or from 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81hoehoe">pāhoehoe</a>
    flows where the lava is moving under the surface.</p>
  
  <p>Lava usually leaves the point of eruption in channels. These channels tend to stay very hot as their surroundings cool. This means they slowly develop walls around them as 
    the surrounding lava cools and/or as the channel melts its way deeper. These channels can get deep enough to crust over, forming an 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_insulation">insulating</a>
    tube that keeps the lava molten and serves as a conduit for the flowing lava. These types of lava tubes tend to be closer to the lava eruption point.</p>
  
  <p>Farther away from the eruption point, lava can flow in an unchanneled, fan-like manner as it leaves its source, which is usually another lava tube leading back to the eruption point. 
    Called pāhoehoe flows, these areas of surface-moving lava cool, forming either a smooth or rough, ropy surface. The lava continues to flow this way until it begins to block its source. 
    At this point, the subsurface lava is still hot enough to break out at a point, and from this point the lava begins as a new "source". Lava flows from the previous source to this 
    breakout point as the surrounding lava of the pāhoehoe flow cools. This forms an underground channel that becomes a lava tube.</p> 
  
  <h2>Characteristics</h2>
  <p><p2>A</p2> broad lava-flow field often consists of a main lava tube and a series of smaller tubes that supply lava to the front of one or more separate flows. When the supply of lava stops at the end of 
    an eruption or lava is diverted elsewhere, lava in the tube system drains downslope and leaves partially empty 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave">caves</a>.</p>
  
  <p>Such drained tubes commonly exhibit step marks on their walls that mark the various depths at which the lava flowed, known as flow ledges or flow lines depending on how prominently they protrude 
    from the walls. Lava tubes generally have pāhoehoe floors, although this may often be covered in breakdown from the ceiling. A variety of 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speleothem">speleothems</a>
    may be found in lava tubes including a variety of 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalactite">stalactite</a> 
    forms generally known as lavacicles, which can be of the splash, "shark tooth", or tubular varieties. Lavacicles are the most common of lava tube speleothems. Drip stalagmites may form 
    under tubular lava stalactites, and the latter may grade into a form known as a tubular lava helictite. A runner is a bead of lava that is extruded from a small opening and then runs down a wall. 
    Lava tubes may also contain mineral deposits that most commonly take the form of crusts or small crystals, and less commonly, as stalactites and stalagmites. Some stalagmites may contain a 
    central conduit and are interpreted as 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornito">hornitos</a> 
    extruded from the tube floor.</p>
  
  <p>Lava tubes can be up to 14–15 metres (46–49 ft) wide, though are often narrower, and run anywhere from 1–15 metres (3 ft 3 in–49 ft 3 in) below the surface. Lava tubes can also be extremely long; 
    one tube from the Mauna Loa 1859 flow enters the ocean about 50 kilometers (31 mi) from its eruption point, and the 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icod_de_los_Vinos#Cueva_del_Viento">Cueva del Viento–Sobrado</a>
    system on Teide, 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenerife">Tenerife</a>
    island, is over 18 kilometers (11 mi) long, due to extensive braided maze areas at the upper zones of the system.</p>
  
  <p>A lava tube system in 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiama">Kiama</a>
    , Australia, consists of over 20 tubes, many of which are breakouts of a main lava tube. The largest of these lava tubes is 2 meters (6.6 ft) in diameter and has 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columnar_jointing">columnar jointing</a> 
    due to the large cooling surface. Other tubes have 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentric">concentric</a>
    and 
    <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/radial">radial</a>
    jointing features. The tubes are infilled due to the low slope angle of emplacement.</p>


  <h2>Extraterrestrial lava tubes</h2> 
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_lava_tube"><p2>L</p2>unar lava tubes</a>
    have been discovered and have been studied as possible human habitats, providing natural shielding from radiation.</p>

    lava tubes are associated with innumerable lava flows and lava channels on the flanks of 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympus_Mons">Olympus Mons</a>. 
    Partially collapsed lava tubes are visible as chains of pit craters, and broad lava fans formed by lava emerging from intact, subsurface tubes are also common.</p>
