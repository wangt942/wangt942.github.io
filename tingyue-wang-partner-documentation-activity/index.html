    <h2>Design Element</h2>
    <p>
   - Blur the boundaries between beginning and end.
    </p>
    <p>
   - Three-column system with navigation bar in the middle.
    </p>
    <p>
   - Left side shows the storyline, right side shows the original text in reverse order.
    </p>
    <p>
   - Effective system that goes in line with the overall concept.
    </p>
    <p>
   - Reorganize hierarchy between title and text.
